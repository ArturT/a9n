Simple tool for managing extra configuration in ruby/rails apps. Supports Rails 2.x, 3.x, 4.x and Ruby 1.9, 2.0. 
Ruby 1.8 is not supported in version 0.1.2 and higher.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'a9n'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Add `configuration.yml.example` and/or `configuration.yml` file into the config
directory. When none fo these files exists, `A9n::MissingConfigurationFile`
exception is thrown.
If both file exist, content of `configuration.yml` is validated. It means that
all keys existing in example file must exist in base file - in case of missing
keys`A9n::MissingConfigurationVariables` is thrown with information about 
missing keys.

Set application root and load configuration by adding to your `application.rb` or `environment.rb` right
after budler requires:

    A9n.root = File.expand_path('../..', __FILE__)
    A9n.load

This step is not required, but recommended, as it configuration is loaded and
verified on evironment load.

It works with `Rails` by default. If you want to use `A9n` with non-rails app
you may need to tell it A9n:

    A9n.local_app = MyApp

## Usage

You can access any variable defined in configuration files but delegating it to 
`A9n`. E.g:

    production:
      app_host: 'http://knapo.net'

is accessible by:

    A9n.app_host
